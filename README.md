## Appendix
### LiveReload Setup
1. Host the page somewhere locally: from the project directory, in a terminal, run `http-server` (by default, hosts at localhost:8080).
1. Host the LiveReload server locally: from the project directory, in another terminal window, run `grunt watch` (by default, uses port: 35729).
1. Add this line to the HTML file you want to LiveReload: `<script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js"></script>` (make sure to have the first two slashes and that the port number matches).
1. Make changes to your files and watch your hosted page LiveReload!
